This is the implementation of an API, which acts as a wrapper above the shared
memory IPC mechanism.

Currently, the operations supported are:
- writing to a buffer 
- reading from a buffer

The API has currently implemented a logging mechanism.

The project uses a Makefile.
For testing the API, a server and client test programs are provided.
The possible targets which can be built are 
- server
- client

The commands which are needed to build the project are:

        make clean
        make

This will build both targets (server + client). 

If only the server target needs to be rebuilt, the commands needed are:
      
        make clean_server
        make server

If only the client target needs to be rebuilt, the commands needed are:

     make clean_client
	 make client
